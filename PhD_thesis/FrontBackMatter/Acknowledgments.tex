\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to address a special thank to my advisor
Karl-Henning Rehren: his constant supervision and 
support have been fundamental and served as 
a guideline throughout all my PhD programme. 
Working on his side has enhanced my general understanding 
of physics, particularly concerning quantum field theory.\\
Also, I would like to acknowledge Marcel Bischoff and Yoh 
Tanimoto for their sharp insights on the algebraic 
structure of quantum field theory and all the related
discussions and exercises in this direction; thanks also
to Pierre Martinetti for very useful suggestions and 
ideas. 

\bigskip 
Moreover, I ought to thank the institution of the
Research Training Group I have been enrolled in, the 
``Graduiertenkolleg 1493 f\"ur
Mathematische Strukturen in der modernen Quantenphysik''
for the grants awarded and the constant financial support 
for conferences, schools and related events, giving me
the possibility to meet interesting people,
as well as to attend useful talks and valuable lectures 
which helped me to enlarge my background, my knowledge and 
my understanding of mathematical physics.

Last but not the least, during my stay here in 
G\"ottingen I have met wonderful
friends who nowadays play a very important role in my life:
not only have they been part of unforgettable memories 
of any kind, but they have also nursed my sorrows all the times,
being on my side under any circumstances, no matter what, no 
matter when. Without their constant support I doubt I could 
have made it the way I actually have. I have therefore learnt
that most of the times it is the hands you shake and the smiles
you receive that make your day, paving your way to go on
even when it rains a lot and the silver linings take 
a little longer to shine back.
