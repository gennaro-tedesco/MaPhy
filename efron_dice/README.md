## Abstract

We present a simple construction of non-transitive set
of dice in some particular cases, deriving a general formula for 
the corresponding non-transitive probabilities. In particular 
we introduce the concept of fully perfect non-transitive set and
show that non-transitive constructions always exist.

Moreover, we make use of the `R` package `Rdice` 
(developed by the author) to show how constructions can be iteratively 
found, provide several example for different cases.
