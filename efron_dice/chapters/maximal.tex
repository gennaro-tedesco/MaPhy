\section{Maximal probabilities for general Efron's dice}
The case of maximal probabilities is much harder to deal with and
we refer the reader to the corresponding literature. In particular
the author in \cite{bogdanov} shows that the maximal probability
for a set of $Z$ dice cannot exceed the value
\begin{equation*}
	p_{\textrm{max}} = 1-\frac{1}{4\cos^2(\pi/(Z+2))}
\end{equation*}
providing examples where the above is just an upper bound as
its irrational value cannot be realised with regular set of dice
as the total number of success and possible cases must still
be integers.
