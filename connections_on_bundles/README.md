## Introduction to the theory of connections on principal bundles

The following notes are meant to be a brief introduction to the theory of connections on principal bundles. The main focus is on the transformation properties of gauge potentials in terms of the geometrical structure of fibre bundles. Electromagnetism as U(1)-bundle gauge theory is provided as an example in the abelian case.

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the ordinary differential calculus and tensor analysis on manifolds.
